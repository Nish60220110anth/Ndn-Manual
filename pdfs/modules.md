# Modules

## Introduction

Modules contain the content this total documentation is made of. They comprise contents such as 

1. Introduction to the module
Explains what is the module about, what is the purpose of the module, what is the module's scope, etc.

2. Files
This part involves explaining the files that are part of the module, what is the purpose of each file, etc.

3. Functions
This part involves explaining the functions that are part of the module, what is the purpose of each function, etc.
Also what are the methods of each class and member variable instances that are part of the module, what is the purpose of each method, etc.

4. Examples
This part involves explaining the examples that are part of the module, what is the purpose of each example, etc.

5. Customization
This part involves explaining the customization that is possible with the module. This part answers questions such as how we can write our custom module of this kind, how i can achieve this functionality with this module, etc.

(For ex. Let's take an example of writing custom forwarding startegy. Now i have questions such as what are files that need to be changed in order to write my custom forwarding strategy, what are the functions that need to be changed in order to write my custom forwarding strategy, how i can use custom tables in my custom forwarding strategy. Can i reuse any components of the existing forwarding strategy. How to change current existing ones to accomdate the chnages i intended to apply. The questions that mentioned here are not concrete, but they are just to give an idea of what this part is about. Some new questions may arise as we go along.)

## Table of contents

This table contains the list of modules that are part of this documentation. Each module is explained in a particular template in separate file.

Template link: [Link](./mod_template.pdf)

Each table entry is attributed with the following information:
1. Name of the module
2. Link to the module's documentation [optional]
3. Link to the module documentation's source file
